This library allows you to implement a pattern lock mechanism in your app **easily and quickly**. It is very easy to use and there are **plenty of customization options** available to change the look-and-feel of this view to match your needs.

It also **supports RxJava 2 view bindings**, so if you are a fan of reactive programming (just like me), you can get a stream of updates as the user draws the pattern.
